Sector idea: 
Sector that used to be where death row inmates were sent to mine to their death, 
it is now controlled by them after they discovered some of the asteroids are actually parts of a corpse of an eldritch god,
the [insert colour] mineral in the astorids is its blood, injecting which provides the recepient with immortality
You battle through the sector, find the main guy who discovered that, his battle is full of temporal shenanigans
You kill him by first destroying rooms with the blood containers in them, then damaging the ship
If you manage without doing any hull damage, you get an aug that can be used at the start of battle to make your crew invincible for a short while
